# GSoC 2019 Ideas
A list of ideas we have planned for GSoC 2019 projects.
If you have any ideas which can be useful to us, but are not in the
list, we would love to hear from you.  You need not be a potential
student or a mentor to suggest ideas.

## Criteria for Ideas
1. It should be helpful for community.
2. It does't involve any other landing page, app or software.
3. Do we have a developer/Mentor _now_ who would be willing and able to do it
   if a student was not available, and who can _promise_ to do it if a
   student is not selected.
4. You can add on any other implementation in our idea list which is missing or necessary.

## Hand Gesture Assistant
**Priority:** High

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Strong Experience with OpenCV and CNN.
 - Experience with Keras.
 - Experience with Python.

**Description**<br>
Main objective is to build hand gesture assistant. People can convey their expression or statement via the gesture software tool.   
Just like a smart phone keypad is able to guess the whole world just by typing a single letter. Our tool will function the same way.
We are combining these resultant gestures and Google Assistant for certain action. <br>
Here is the prototype what we are thinking !

**Note:** Our tool would be also beneficial for the Mute Community. They can convey their expression and statement through hand gesture assistant.

**Project Task Checklist**<br> 
 - Hand gesture assistant would intelligently sense alphabet, words and even sentences by the mean of gestures.
 - Once the human gesture is over then resultant word (In the form of text) should be converted into text and speech.
 - Speech should be compatible in different languages.
 - Combine text and google assistant for taking action.

## Argon
**Priority:** High

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python and REST API.
 - Experience with Data Visualization.

**Description**<br>
Argon is a python based library which is used to monitor the website health, website traffic and visualize the data.
The task is to build a MVP as a solution which will be integrating a REST API for querying and extracting the data of parameters mentioned above.
Data will be visualised with the help of open source libraries such as [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn). and [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and will be displayed to the user.

**Project Task Checklist**<br> 
 - REST API will be integrated with the library for extraction of data.
 - The data extracted should be checked for its correctness over various targeted parameters.
 - Integration of libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn to visualise the fetched data.
 - Generation of corresponding CSV of the fetched data.
