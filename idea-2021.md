## Dynamic-CLI

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python.
 - Experience with sockets.
 - Strong experience with HTTP/HTTPS and API Testing.
 - Experience with [xonsh](https://xon.sh/) is a plus.

**Description**<br> A modern, user-friendly command-line HTTP client to test their APIs locally within the terminal. Previously developers use this tool to get the data from StackOverflow in the terminal but now we are expanding this tool to something new i.e API testing through command-line. 


**Project Task Checklist**<br>
 - Build Expressive and intutive syntax feature in the terminal.
 - Formatted and colorised terminal output.
 - Build-in JSON support for response.
 - HTTPS, Proxies and Authentication for the API's.
 - Custom headers for the API section.
 - Autocomplete feature.
 - CLI support for mac, windows and linux.

## Design Gallery

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with UI/UI
 - Strong experience with frontend framework preferable React
 - Experience with REST API's.

**Description**<br>
The design gallery is a theme-based gallery (Design Kitchen) that will show the illustration/logos/Images contributed by the open-source in our [iosf-design](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/iosf-design).
We will make the gallery more interesting where all the contributors are called design chefs. Quality illustrations were available for our designs with customizable color(s), objects that can be combined and modified to create new exciting images, and a design style that balances art and tech to future-proof your designs.
Use images that scale without quality degradation, making them not just retina but future-ready. With a tiny file size, combine dozens of SVG images without worries about speed and with the ability to embed them to minimize requests, for blazing-fast loading times.

**Project Task Checklist**<br>
 - Design all the screens for our iosf-design.
 - Build a basic website with all the screen. (Design Kitchen)
 - Get and Manage the data from iosf-design.
 - Add customizable color feature.
 - Generate embedded code feature to convert our image to code without degrading quality.

# Administrative notes


## Coding Mentors
For each idea, we must have offers from one or more _coding mentors_
willing and able to assist students with coding questions.

Requirements for a _coding mentor_ are a demonstrated coding ability
in the form of contributions of code to IOSF.

Mentors for a project will be assigned after proposals are received.

## Assisting Mentors
For each idea, we may have offers from mentors _who do not code_
willing to assist students in various other ways, such as gathering
requirements, visual design, testing, and deployment; these are shown
as an assisting mentor.

The only requirement for an assisting mentor is knowledge of the
project.

Mentors for a project will be assigned after proposals are received.
