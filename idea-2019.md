# GSoC 2019 Ideas
A list of ideas we have planned for GSoC 2019 projects.
If you have any ideas which can be useful to us, but are not in the
list, we would love to hear from you.  You need not be a potential
student or a mentor to suggest ideas.

## Criteria for Ideas
1. It should be helpful for community.
2. It does't involve any other landing page, app or software.
3. Do we have a developer/Mentor _now_ who would be willing and able to do it
   if a student was not available, and who can _promise_ to do it if a
   student is not selected.
4. You can add on any other implementation in our idea list which is missing or necessary.
